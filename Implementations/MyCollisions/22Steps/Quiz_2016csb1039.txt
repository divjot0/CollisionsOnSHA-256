3. The scholar's rock is heavy - this is evident in every scene where the rock is there. On the day when the house gets destroyed the rock floats over water. And the boy takes it. This rock was The trigger for the ideas inside the boys mind. He was already frustrated with what was happening and angry at how things were going, so when he saw the rock, he saw this rock as the way out of the mess.

4. I don't think what happened to Mr Park was fair. Although it is explanable using the freudian logic why the driver was angry and eventually killed him, I think Mr Park was a very good man and his virtues did not deserve the treatment he got. Mr Park talking about the driver being "unhiegenic" or trying to protect his family before others might not fit well with the driver's morality but that does not give him the right to choose death for him. Another instance of unfair treatment can be observed during the whole movie where the woman of the house is fooled around by everyone she trusts. It is not okay to use somebody as a mean to achieve your objectives which was clearly being done by everyone she met. The treatment was not fair.
