The Buddha says that suffering is a part of human existence. He explains this by saying that due to natural selection, humans have gotten a tendency to attach to things. We believe that things are going to last forever, however, according to Buddha - everything is impermanent. And this is what causes suffering. We get attached to happiness (, say) and it ends. The diagnosis he gives is kind of a path that is supposed to end all suffering by us accepting the impermanence of things. 

I agree with The Buddha's belief that clinging to things is the cause of suffering. I believe that if something makes me suffer, it would imply that the thing meant something to me and that I thought that that thing would result in something before I suffer. It seems natural, therefore, that if I did not have an attachment to this thing, I would not have suffered.

On the same lines, let's look at an experience of mine, I was preparing for some exam and had prepared a lot. But I failed. And was sad. The cause of my sadness was that I had gotten very attached to my success which is basically clinging to things. And is the cause of suffering as said by The Buddha.
