Put conditions on A8 and find 22 step collision.

-----
Extend 17 step collision to 22 step collision. [totally doable]                          Done!

-----
Put constraints over W16 and W14 and choose others such that these work out.

-----
Multi block collisions.

-----
Pick a random solution of linear equations and check if it is valid. [TRY]

-----
Tonights task :
Create a program to look at only how to go from E7 to E8. (given E7 look at a uniformly random possible option for E8)
